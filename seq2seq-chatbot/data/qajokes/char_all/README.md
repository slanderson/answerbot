## Character-level model (with punctuation)
When data.py is run in the parent directory, this directory will be populated with processed 
data files that are ready to train a character-level joke-answering model (with punctuation retained, but with
unusual characters such as emojis and characters from other alphabets removed). 
This dataset is not the same as the word-level model, because punctuation is retained.
